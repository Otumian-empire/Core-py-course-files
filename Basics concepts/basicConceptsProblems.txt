If you are reading this write up, it means you are preparing yourself for the next level of the course. 
Questions here are to equip you and help you develop some sense of problem solving skill

A. Write a program that calculates and displays the :

1. average of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0} (make sure that they are 10 in number)

2. area of a circle of radius, 10cm (use str so that you can add the cm to the result, 
the value of pi = 22/7)

3. perimeter and area of a rectangle of length, 14cm and breadth, 8cm

4. simple interest on $2000.00 for 10years at 5% (5% = 5/100 = 0.05)

5. the age of a person born in 1957 and diplay, "1957 borns are age(this is the result) years old"

6. 3x^2-2x+5, where x = 2 (use the pow function at x^2, where x is the base, 2 the exponent)

7. remainder of  61, 123, 345, 712 and 415 when divided by 6

8. remainder of sum of { 61, 123, 345, 712, 415} when divided by 6

B. here you take input from the user to solve the above problems in A from 1 - 8

C. This problems is for you to dig deep.. Make use of a friend or google
These are carefully selected questions to increase your problem solving skill

1. Write a program that prompts the user to input a length expressed in cen-
timeters. The program should then convert the length to inches (to the nearest
inch) and output the length expressed in yards, feet, and inches, in that order.
For example, suppose the input for centimeters is 312. To the nearest inch, 312
centimeters is equal to 123 inches. 123 inches would thus be output as:
3 yard(s), 1 feet (foot), and 3 inch(es).

2. One metric ton is approximately 2205 pounds. Write a program that
prompts the user to input the amount of rice, in pounds, in a bag. The
program outputs the number of bags needed to store one metric ton of rice

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of a person in
kilograms and outputs the equivalent weight in pounds. Output both the
weights rounded to two decimal places. (Note that 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds.) 
Format your output with two decimal places.

4. Three employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. You are
given a file, say Ch3_Ex8Data.txt, with the following data:

Miller Andrew  65789.87  5
Green Sheila  75892.56  6
Sethi Amit  74900.50  6.1

Each input line consists of an employeeâ€™s last name, first name, current salary,
and percent pay increase. For example, in the first input line, the last name of
the employee is
Miller, the first name is Andrew, the current salary is 65789.87, and pay increase is
5%. Write a program that reads data from the specified file and stores the output in the file
Ch3_Ex8Output.dat.

For each employee, the data must be output in the following form:
firstName lastName updatedSalary. Format the output of decimal numbers to two decimal places.

5. Write a program that accepts as input the mass, in grams, and density, in
grams per cubic centimeters, and outputs the volume of the object using the formula:
density = mass / volume. Format your output to two decimal places.

GOOD CODING


if there was a concept that you didn't get well, i will encourage you to watch the video again or 
use google to find information on that topic. Remember as a programmer, one skill that would make 
you standout is how use make you of your searching skill
